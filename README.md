# Snake-Game
A simple snake game built in python

This project was fairly easy to make. I mean, there is not really much to it. However, it was a bit challenging for me to make all the coordinates and logic for the program based off of an array, rather than pixels. It took me about one afternoon(3 hours). Anyways, I have always wanted to make this classic game because I used to play it a lot when I was younger.
